                    <h3>Divestment in Japan: DAI-VESTO-MENTO!</h3>
                <p>
                  (October 6, 2016) Record-breaking torrential rain in the southern parts of Japan, scorching temperatures that led to water limits in the east, including the capital area around Tokyo, and a number of record-breaking typhoons hit Japan. The simple truth of causing such abnormal weather patterns is betrayed by opaque media coverage and, as a result, less and less obvious to the Japanese public. This 3 minutes quirky video answered this ugly truth. Your money is actually propelling the climate crisis. Also, your money is being funneled into unsustainable energy, including climate change-driving fossil fuels. It can be changed by join Divestment movement.

                    <h3>KEPCO cancelled Ako coal projects: First cancellation of coal plant since new projects emerged these years</h3>
                    </a>
                <p>
                  (January 31, 2017) Kansai Electric Power Company (KEPCO) announced cancellation of Ako power plant located in Ako city, Hyogo. The reason for their decision is the fall in electricity demand due to energy saving and energy efficiency improvements, and the requirement to strengthen its CO2 reduction measures. Since this plant, has been constructed, criticism from local residents has been on the rise. Ako coal plant’s cancellation became the first case since new coal projects emerged last few years, up to 48 units. Besides this case, there are other 45 coal power projects in Japan has been cancelled.

                    <h3>Developers Announced the Cancellation of New Coal Power Project in Ichihara, Chiba</h3>
                    </a>
                <p>
                  (March 23, 2017) On March 23rd, Tonen General Sekiyu and Kanden Energy Solution Co. (KENES) announced to cancel the plan to build a 1,000-megawatt coal-fired power plant. According to the release, Tonen General Sekiyu and Kanden Energy Solution Co. decided not to consider the commercialization of the project based on the “changes in the feasibility and the surrounding environment”. Among the 49 units under plan since 2012, this became the second case of cancellation since Kansai Electric Power Company (KEPCO) announced to cancel the retrofit project of Ako power plant in Hyogo in January 2017. This became the first case of cancellation on a new construction project.
