                    <h3>We stand with Bataan in saying no to coal.</h3>
                <p>
                  Solar and wind energy are now at the same price or even cheaper than new fossil fuels in over 30 countries, according to the World Economic Forum. It is both ironic and tragic then that companies like SMC Consolidated Power Corporation (SMCCPC) continue to operate destructive coal plants and dump bottom ash harmful to nearby communities, such as in Limay, Bataan. Therefore, the Environmental Management Bureau in Central Luzon has already ordered SMCCPC to stop any activity inside its coal plant in the wake of the ash spill that has caused several residents in the nearby communities to fall ill.

                <p>
                  (March 27, 2017) In 2016, anti-coal communities converged in Batangas City to advance their demand for the cancellation of all plans, permits and construction of coal-fired power plants in Batangas and the rest of the country. Around 10,000 people took to the streets under the banner of Piglas Pilipinas! The event was monumental because it was the biggest act of public protest against coal plants in the Philippines, which made the growing resistance against fossil fuels reach national consciousness. The result was a series of policy momentum that materialized into the Philippines’ ratification of the Paris Agreement in spite of the initial delays driven by Duterte’s hesitation to sign it.

                  In Tuguegarao, Cagayan, the storm’s strong winds blew the destroying homes, bringing down power lines and felling trees, which rendered some roads impassable because of the debris. President Rodrigo Duterte rightfully blamed rich and industrialized nations for harmful emissions that have led to climate change and extreme weather disturbances. But he refused to reduce Philippines’ emission due to economic development and industrialization. He also signaled that the Philippines would not be ratifying the Paris Agreement. However, climate change does not recognize geopolitical borders nor interest. The Philippine government should have assert a place for itself at the negotiating table by ratifying the Paris Agreement and take action against carbon emission.
